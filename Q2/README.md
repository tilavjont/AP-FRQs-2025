## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Get the easy points through class header, constructor, and get method. For the addSignature, check if its in the beginning, then anywhere else in the word, then if its not both of those, it HAS to not be there so the last else is for it not being there.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I did not revise my solution
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- class structure, get methods, string object methods
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Ideas here
