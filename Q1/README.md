## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- If the max dogs is more than or equal to num available, (the dog walker can handle the amount), than the # returned is the total available, if not return what the walker is capable of(maxdogs)
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I intitially used an else if during the exam, but then changed it to else because if its not the first option, then it has to be the second
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Operators, variables, if statements, loop
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I didn't learn much, I pretty much nailed it down first time during the exam.
