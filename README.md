# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Tilavjon Tolibov*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 05/07/2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included practicing mcq questions and doing frqs
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the timing of the mcq
- Time management techniques that worked well for me skipping a question when I'm stuck
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions were writing down my steps, and looking at examples.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: [Recursion topic, I was unsure about some recursion MCQ questions]
- Topic/Concept 2: [Polymorphism. I got confused between which class can morph into the other and which cannot]
- Programming practice: [JuiceMind FRQ's really helped me understand them]

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [CSAwesome](https://www.csawesome.org/)
- [JuiceMind](https://www.juicemind.com/)

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Learn cybersecurity
- Finish Game of Life(2D array)
- More mcq practice with timed pressure
